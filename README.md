## Instructions for students:

### 7 Boxes

1. Refresh your Flexbox skills with this fun game: [flexboxfroggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com)

2. Create 7 Boxes on the page and give each a background color as in the reference imageges

3. Using `flex` and media queries, make the page responsive. Use semantic class namings to style the boxes. i.e `.flex-container`, `.flex-item-1`, `.flex-item-2`, etc.

**Breakpoints:**

   * 0px-600px: boxes 1-7 should each take up 100% of a row

   * 601px-800px: boxes 1 and 2 should each take up 100% of a row, 3, 4 and 5 should each take up 33.33% of a row, and 6 and 7 should each take up 100% of a row

   * 801px and above: boxes 1 and 2 should each take up 50% of a row, 3, 4 and 5 each should take up 33.33% of a row, and 6 & 7 should each take up 50% of a row
